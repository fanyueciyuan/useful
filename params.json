We are currently using racoon as the vpn software and we are adding ssl vpn (ocserv) that supports cisco anyconnect soon. please star this project if you want.\r\nIPSecAuto for Debain: ipsecauto.sh in this repo. IPSecAuto for CentOS: ipsecauto-centos.sh in this repo.\r\nReleased under GNU GPLv2.\r\nbug reports: frjalex@gmail.com\r\n\r\nIKEv2Auto\r\n========================\r\nIKEv2Auto is still in Alpha. It is originally IPSecAuto2 and has an amazing support of IPSec IKEv2. That means it supports windows and windows phone. We're still developing a version for ArchLinux now.\r\n\r\nsslVPNauto\r\n==========================\r\nA one-click installation script to install and configure a Cisco Anyconnect server on your Debian 7 system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***Requirements***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMust add testing and Wheezy-backports system.\r\nFor adding wheezy-backports, see the tutorial at http://backports.debian.org\r\n\r\n\r\nMust install `wget` `gcc` `make` `build-essential`, etc.\r\n\r\n***note that ocserv requires really complex dependencies. I recommend that everybody to do the compile oneself and use this script to configure. You must add missing dependencies on your own. As for the PAM support, this script will install the PAM auth library(libpam0g-dev) by default for future support of ocserv PAM. ***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMust be Debian Wheezy.\r\n\r\nWe currently ONLY support the installation on debian wheezy, no other systems.\r\nThe solution is provided by Ocserv authored by Mark, see http://infradead.org/ .\r\n\r\nLiscencing & Legal\r\n===========================\r\nAll contents, softwares, repos, and scripts' copyrights owned by Alex Fang, all rights reserved.\r\nCopyright (C) 2013-2015 Alex Fang Email:frjalex@gmail.com\r\nReleased under the GNU GPLv2 License.\r\nLicense:\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
